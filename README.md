#### Recursive Patterns: Integer Powers of Real Numbers

#### A Theory on Number Computing
### Somefun's Square Method
###### The square of any positive or negative real number value, n can be decomposed into the expression below:

![ square(n) = [(n - 1 ) * (3 + (n - 2))] + 1](efun_sq.gif)

#### Any real number, r raised to an integer power, n can be calculated recursively from
