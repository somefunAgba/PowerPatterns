###### Recursive Patterns: Integer Powers of Real Numbers

# A Theory on Number Computing

### 1. Somefun's Square Method
###### The square of any positive or negative real number value, n can be decomposed into the expression below:
![ square(n) = [(n - 1 ) * (3 + (n - 2))] + 1](efun_sq.gif)
### 2. Somefun's Power Patterns
###### Any real number, n raised to an integer power, r can be decomposed into a recursive pattern or series of integer powers.

#### A Visualization of the *Somefun's Power Pattern Algorithm* is implemented using Python.
